                    <h3>Mental Health Journal</h3>
                    <p>Create a digital journal application focused on mental well-being.
                        Users can log their thoughts, feelings, and daily activities, 
                        and the app can provide insights based on their entries,
                        such as mood tracking and guided mindfulness exercises.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Virtual Event Planner</h3>
                    <p>Create a platform that helps users organize virtual events, such as webinars or online workshops.
                        The project could include features for scheduling, sending invitations, managing RSVPs, 
                        and providing tools for hosting interactive sessions</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Virtual Assistant (Term Project)</h3> 
                    <p>The term project is a virtual assistant designed to schedule, track, record, and analyze events according to user design. 
                        The user can schedule events in a specific or recurring manner and view them from a calendar. 
                        These scheduled events are connected to an interface the user can design for recording the information they choose upon completing the event. 
                        The recording feature is designed to work without scheduled events as well, allowing the user to record more spontaneous activity. 
                        The data from these events will be stored and accessible en masse for analysis of time usage and comparisons specific to the properties the user chooses to record. 
                        The user will be required to log in, only allowing each user to access their information. 
                        This assistant improves the productivity of individuals in business and personal settings through its quick and flexible design. 
                        The user can swiftly organize themselves and design each detail to their specific needs. 
                        Choice of properties to record allows the user to organize the information recorded about each event for easy analysis later. 
                        Requiring the user to log in ensures security for each user's personal data. 
                        The ability to record actions and analyze time expenditure as well as specific properties provides the user with an easy method of analyzing data about their time and 
                        specifically recorded information to make informed decisions on how to solve user-specific problems and promote a balanced lifestyle.</p>
